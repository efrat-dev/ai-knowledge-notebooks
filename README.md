# AI-KNOWLEDGE-NOTEBOOKS 🧠📘

This repository contains my personal theoretical notes on key concepts in:

- Machine Learning  
- Deep Learning  
- Data Science  
- Artificial Intelligence  

The notes are written entirely by me as part of my independent study journey, and are aimed at consolidating core theoretical knowledge in a clear, structured, and accessible format.

## 📚 What’s Inside

Each Jupyter notebook focuses on theoretical understanding, and includes:
- Definitions and principles
- Mathematical foundations
- Explanations of algorithms and methods
- Key terminology and concepts
- Comparisons between approaches
- References to academic papers and open-source documentation

🛑 **Note:** This repository does **not** include code, implementation, or practical demos. It is intended as a clean, theory-focused knowledge base.
