    "## 📌 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence serves as a high-level framework for intelligent behavior in machines. It incorporates machine learning models, domain expertise, and system design to build systems that can perceive, reason, and act. In domains like healthcare, AI empowers clinicians by combining predictive analytics, real-time decision-making, and domain knowledge — all enabled through close collaboration between ML engineers, data scientists, and domain experts.\n"
