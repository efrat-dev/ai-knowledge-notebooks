    "# 📂 Train-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting your dataset is a critical step in building reliable machine learning models. The goal is to evaluate how well a model generalizes to **unseen data**, not just how well it memorizes the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Basic Split: Train/Test\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Set**:  \n",
    "  This subset is used to **train** the model – the model adjusts its internal parameters based on this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Set**:  \n",
    "  This separate subset is used to **evaluate** the final model. It simulates new data the model hasn’t seen before, helping us assess its generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "📏 **Typical Split Ratios**:  \n",
    "- 80% training / 20% testing  \n",
    "- 90% training / 10% testing\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ Important: The split must be random (unless working with time series), and in classification tasks, consider using **stratified sampling** to preserve label distribution.\n",

    "## ⚠️ Risk of Overfitting to the Test Set\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model selection or hyperparameter tuning is done using the **test set**, we risk **overfitting** to it.  \n",
    "This makes our final evaluation **unreliable**, because we’ve essentially \"peeked\" at future data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧪📊 Train / Validation / Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid overfitting to the test set, it’s best to split the data into **three** parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Set**: Used to fit the model (optimize internal parameters).  \n",
    "- **Validation Set**: Used for **model selection**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **early stopping**.  \n",
    "- **Test Set**: Used **only once**, after model tuning is complete, for final unbiased evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "📏 **Typical Ratios**:\n",
    "- 75% training  \n",
    "- 15% validation  \n",
    "- 10% test\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Key Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **small datasets**, use **cross-validation** instead of a fixed validation set.\n",
    "- For **time series data**, avoid random splits; respect chronological order (e.g., use forward chaining).\n",
    "- A good data split leads to a trustworthy evaluation and better real-world performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "## ✅ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Data splitting is a foundational step for any machine learning workflow.  \n",
    "Using a **train/validation/test split** ensures that your model is trained properly, tuned wisely, and evaluated fairly."
